    "# Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal from this analysis will be to predict the outcome of March Madness games. To do this, I will look at historical data from NCAA tourney matchups from 2003 up to 2018 output predictions for the winning team for each game. For every March Madness game, each team will be assigned a score based on its regular season performance in  several statistical categories, assigned rankings, and how well its oppponent performs in several statistical categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Models\n",
    "I will be using a few baseline models to compare the model's results against. The baseline models I will be using are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - March Madness Seed: The seed assigned to each team for a March Madness tournament\n",
    "    - Rating Percentage Index (RPI):  Ranking assigned to each team based on a team's wins, losses, and strength of record\n",
    "    - Pomeroy College Basketball Ratings (POM): Ken Pomeroy's annual college basketball ratings \n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline models pose the following hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - That in any NCAA tournament game, the winner of a game will have either a lower March Madness seed, lower RPI, or lower POM rating.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Intuitively, this is a reasonable prediction. RPI, March Madness seeds, and POM ratings are all based on a team's wins, losses, strength of schedule, and generally considered representative of a team's performance relative to other teams. If team A has a lower RPI than team B at the end of a season, it's generally considered that team A's performance throughout the season has been at a higher level than team B's. For this reason, if we knew nothing else about the two teams, predicting the outcome based on RPI, or the other two benchmarks, is a good starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources Overview\n",
    "The data that was used to perform this analysis came from the [Google Cloud & NCAA® ML Competition 2018-Men's Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018). The following is a brief summary of all the datasets that were used:\n",
    "- NCAATourneyCompactResults: Contains records from each NCAA tournament game from 1985-2017, including score and region.  \n",
    "- Teams: Contains information for each Division 1 (D1) basketball team including an ID, name, first and most recent year playing D1 basketball. \n",
    "- MasseyOrdinals_Prelim2018: Contains data from 2003-2017 surrounding each D1 team's rank from various rankings sources throughout. \n",
    "- RegularSeasonDetailedResults: Contains similar information as the NCAATourneyCompactResults dataset, with the addition that each row will also contain the totals in a variety of statistical categories for the winning team and losing team. These are categories that are often found in a boxscore. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Data Cleansing & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the model to be created, the following was completed:\n",
    "    1. A data frame was created that holds a set of statistics for each team in a given year used to evaluate the that team's offensive and defensive performance. \n",
    "    2. A data frame was created, where each row represents a matchup that occurred in an NCAA tournament and contains the set of statistics for each team in the matchup \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish the first task, the following statistics were calculated for each team:\n",
    "    - Three Point Percentage (3P%)\n",
    "    - Two Point Percentage (2P%)\n",
    "    - Defensive Rebounds (DR)\n",
    "    - Offensive Rebounds (OR)\n",
    "    - Field Goal Percentage (FG%)\n",
    "    - Free Throws Attempted (FTA)\n",
    "    - Free Throw Percentage (FTP)\n",
    "    - Turnovers (TO)\n",
    "    - Turnovers Forced (TOF)\n",
    "    - Personal Fouls (PF)\n",
    "    - Efficient Field Goal Percentage (eFG): (FGM + 0.5 * 3PM) / FGA\n",
    "    - Possessions (POS): FGA - ORB + TO + (0.4 x FTA)\n",
    "    - Defensive Efficiency (dEff): 100 x PA / (FGA - ORB + TO + (0.4 x FTA))   \n",
    "    - Offensive Effiency (oEff): 100 x (PS) / (FGA - ORB + TO + (0.4 x FTA))\n",
    "    - Three Point Usage (3PP): 3PA / FGA\n",
    "    - Two Point Usage (2PP): 2PA / FGA\n",
    "    - Rankings Percentage Index (RPI)\n",
    "    - March Madness Seed (Seed)\n",
    "    - Ken Pomeroy Rating (POM)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each statistic was calcualated using game data leading up to the tournament, including conference play. RPI, March Madness Seed, and POM ratings were found using the latest ranking given to a team before the tournament.\n",

    "Using the normalized statistics data frame and a data frame consisting of historical records of each March Madness tournament matchup, a score can be calculated for each team to predict the outcome of a tournament game. Each team is given a score based on several criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Offensive Performance Score\n",
    "$$ OffScore_A = oEff_A*(1 - dEff_B) + 4(3P\\%_A) + 8(2P\\%_A) + 5FTA_A + 3.5FT\\%_A + 2OR_A - 2.5TO_A $$\n",
    "A team's offensive performance score is based on several features:\n",
    "- Offensive Efficiency: $oEff_A*(1 - dEff_B)$: \n",
    "    - Using team A's offensive efficiency gives a good estimate of how many points per 100 possessions a team scores. From that value, a team is only granted a percentage of it based on how well team B plays defense. \n",
    "- Shooting: $4(3P\\%_A) + 8(2P\\%_A) + 5FTA_A + 3.5FT\\%_A$\n",
    "    - A team is rewarded for how well they shoot three pointers, two pointers, and free throws, as well as how many free throws they shoot a game. \n",
    "- Rebounding & Turnovers: $2OR_A - 2.5TO_A$: \n",
    "    - Team A is rewarded if they tend to be better at offensive rebounding than other teams and are penalized for how often they turn the ball over. \n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Defensive Performance Score:\n",
    "$$ DefScore_A = 8.5(1-dEff_A) + 5DR_A + 3TOF_A - 5PF_A $$\n",
    "Team A is rewarded based on their defensive efficiency, how well they rebound defensively, how often they force turnovers, and penalized for how often they foul. \n",
    "#### External Ranking Score: \n",
    "$$ ExtRankScore_A = 12.5(1 - Seed_A) + 10(1 - POM_A) + 7.5(1 - RPI_A) $$ \n",
    "A team is given an external ranking score based on their RPI before the tournament, their March Madness seed, and where they stand in Ken Pomeroy's end of the season rankings. The lower the ranking or seeding, the higher the reward. Coefficients for each metric were based on how well each one independently predicted March Madness games.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cumulative Score\n",

    "$$ FinScore = OffScore + DefScore + ExtRankScore $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once scores are calculated for each team in each matchup, a prediction for the outcome of a game is made by selecting the team with a higher score as the winner. A final data frame is created showing the scores calculated for each team, how  my model performed predicting the outcome of the game, and how each baseline model performed predicting the outcome of the game.
