    "# Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal from this analysis will be to predict the outcome of March Madness games. To do this, we will be using a random forest classifer that takes in historical data from NCAA tourney matchups as input and outputs predictions for the winning team for each game in an input set of March Madness games. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The baseline model we will use to compare our model's results against will be solely tied to a team's RPI. Our baseline model poses the following hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    That in any NCAA tournament game, the team with the lower RPI will win the game.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Intuitively, this is a reasonable prediction. RPI (Ratings Percentage Index), ranks teams based on their wins, losses, and strength of schedule for the past season. If team A has a lower RPI than team B at the end of a season, it's generally considered that team A's performance throughout the season has been at a higher level than team B's. For this reason, if we knew nothing else about the two teams, predicting the outcome based on RPI is a good starting point. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources Overview\n",
    "The data the was used to perform this analysis came from the Google Cloud & NCAAÂ® ML Competition 2018-Men's Kaggle competition (Insert Link). The following is a brief summary of all the datasets that were used:\n",
    "- NCAATourneyCompactResults: Contains records from each NCAA tournament game from 1985-2017, including score and region.  \n",
    "- Teams: Contains information for each Division 1 (D1) basketball team including an ID, name, first and most recent year playing D1 basketball. \n",
    "- MasseyOrdinals_Prelim2018: Contains data from 2003-2017 surrounding each D1 team's rank from various rankings sources throughout. \n",
    "- RegularSeasonDetailedResults: Contains similar information as the NCAATourneyCompactResults dataset, with the addition that each row will also contain the totals in a variety of statistical categories for the winning team and losing team. These are categories that are often found in a boxscore. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more in depth description of each of the datasets that were used and additional datasets provided by Kaggle can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data\n"

    "### Data Cleansing & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create our random forest, we need to complete the following:\n",
    "    1. Settle on a set of statistics to evaluate the performance of each team. \n",
    "    2. Create a data frame that represents a matchup that occurred in an NCAA tournament and contains our set of statistics for each team in the matchup \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish the first task, the following statistics were calculated for each team:\n",
    "    - Defensive Rebounds (DRB)\n",
    "    - Efficient Field Goal Percentage (EFG)\n",
    "    - Free Throws Attempted (FTA)\n",
    "    - Free Throw Percentage (FTP)\n",
    "    - Margin of Loss (MOL)\n",
    "    - Margin of Victory (MOV)\n",
    "    - Offensive Rebounds (ORB)\n",
    "    - Possessions (POSS)\n",
    "    - Turnovers (TO)\n",
    "    - Turnovers Forced (TOF)\n",
    "    - Defensive Efficiency (dEff)\n",
    "    - Offensive Effiency (oEff)\n",
    "    - Rankings Percentage Index (RPI)\n",
    "    - Conference Tourney Wins (confTournWins)\n",
    "    - Wins vs. a Tournament Team (winsVsTourney)\n",
    "    - Number of Games Played (numGamesPlayed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of the last four, the yearly pre-tournament averages (regular season and conference tourney play) were found. The last three are cumulative totals, and RPI was found by using the latest ranking given to a team before the tournament. \n",
    "\n",
    "By parsing through the 4 datasets listed above, we can calculate the desired information for each team in a March Madness tournament from 2003-2017 as seen below:"
