    "# Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal from this analysis will be to predict the outcome of March Madness games. To do this, we will be using a random forest classifer that takes in historical data from NCAA tourney matchups as input and outputs predictions for the winning team for each game in an input set of March Madness games. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "The baseline model we will use to compare our model's results against will be solely tied to a team's RPI. Our baseline model poses the following hypothesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "    That in any NCAA tournament game, the team with the lower RPI will win the game.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Intuitively, this is a reasonable prediction. RPI (Ratings Percentage Index), ranks teams based on their wins, losses, and strength of schedule for the past season. If team A has a lower RPI than team B at the end of a season, it's generally considered that team A's performance throughout the season has been at a higher level than team B's. For this reason, if we knew nothing else about the two teams, predicting the outcome based on RPI is a good starting point. \n",
    "### Random Forest Approach\n",
    "We would like to build on our baseline model and see if we can develop an approach that more accurately predicts the outcome of games. One of the most exciting parts of March Madness is the array of upsets that occur throughout the tournament. In general, upsets occur when a team with a higher RPI beats a team with a lower RPI. We would like to create a model that performs better than our baseline model by more accurately predicting the outcome of games, in particular predicting when upsets occur. For us to accomplish this, we can utilize RPI as well as some additional attributes that provide more information surrounding each team's level of performance in the past season. These factors can be used to build a random forest in order to: \n",
    "    1. Predict when an upset is going to occur in March Madness\n",
    "    2. Identify which factors are correlated to predicting the outcome of a game\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a random forest by passing as input a data frame where each row corresponds to an NCAA tournament game. Each row will contain data regarding each team's yearly averages and totals in statistical categories, RPI, the game's outcome, and whether or not the team with the lowest RPI won. This last piece of information will be our dependent variable. The random forest will utilize features in our training data describing the winning team and losing team's performance during the season, in order to learn which factors are tied to predicting the outcome of a game. Once the random forest has been trained, tournament data where the outcome of the each game has been excluded can be used as input to the model to generate a set of predictions for each game in that year's tournament and test the accuracy of our random forest classifer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources Overview\n",
    "The data the was used to perform this analysis came from the Google Cloud & NCAA® ML Competition 2018-Men's Kaggle competition (Insert Link). The following is a brief summary of all the datasets that were used:\n",
    "- NCAATourneyCompactResults: Contains records from each NCAA tournament game from 1985-2017, including score and region.  \n",
    "- Teams: Contains information for each Division 1 (D1) basketball team including an ID, name, first and most recent year playing D1 basketball. \n",
    "- MasseyOrdinals_Prelim2018: Contains data from 2003-2017 surrounding each D1 team's rank from various rankings sources throughout. \n",
    "- RegularSeasonDetailedResults: Contains similar information as the NCAATourneyCompactResults dataset, with the addition that each row will also contain the totals in a variety of statistical categories for the winning team and losing team. These are categories that are often found in a boxscore. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more in depth description of each of the datasets that were used and additional datasets provided by Kaggle can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data\n"

    "### Data Cleansing & Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to create our random forest, we need to complete the following:\n",
    "    1. Settle on a set of statistics to evaluate the performance of each team. \n",
    "    2. Create a data frame that represents a matchup that occurred in an NCAA tournament and contains our set of statistics for each team in the matchup \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish the first task, the following statistics were calculated for each team:\n",
    "    - Defensive Rebounds (DRB)\n",
    "    - Efficient Field Goal Percentage (EFG)\n",
    "    - Free Throws Attempted (FTA)\n",
    "    - Free Throw Percentage (FTP)\n",
    "    - Margin of Loss (MOL)\n",
    "    - Margin of Victory (MOV)\n",
    "    - Offensive Rebounds (ORB)\n",
    "    - Possessions (POSS)\n",
    "    - Turnovers (TO)\n",
    "    - Turnovers Forced (TOF)\n",
    "    - Defensive Efficiency (dEff)\n",
    "    - Offensive Effiency (oEff)\n",
    "    - Rankings Percentage Index (RPI)\n",
    "    - Conference Tourney Wins (confTournWins)\n",
    "    - Wins vs. a Tournament Team (winsVsTourney)\n",
    "    - Number of Games Played (numGamesPlayed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of the last four, the yearly pre-tournament averages (regular season and conference tourney play) were found. The last three are cumulative totals, and RPI was found by using the latest ranking given to a team before the tournament. \n",
    "\n",
    "By parsing through the 4 datasets listed above, we can calculate the desired information for each team in a March Madness tournament from 2003-2017 as seen below:"

    "The matchups data frame can be used as input to a random forest classifier to output predictions for a subset of NCAA tournament games. When creating a random forest classifer, a few parameters should be considered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- _Maximum Number of Features_: The maximum number of features that our algorithm uses to create a decision tree that will be a part of our random forest. A value of sqrt(n) where n is the number of features in our input dataset was chosen. This is generally considered to be a good starting point for random forest classifiers because it allows the decision trees that are created to have a strong chance of selecting a unique set of features to train a model with. The more unique our set of decision trees are, the more confident we can be in our random forest's performance on test data. \n",
    "- _Number of Trees_: The number of trees in a random forest impacts the classifier's effectiveness for similar reason. If not enough decision trees are chosen, some features may not be included in our model and the classifer's effectiveness is hindered. The more trees in a forest, the more likely we cover the full feature space. To have a strong chance of covering the full feature space, 1000 trees were selected to be in our random forest.\n",

    "For this project, random forests classifiers were created for two use cases:\n",
    "    1. Predicting the outcome of all NCAA tournament games from one season between 2003-2017\n",
    "    2. Predicting the outcome of all NCAA tournament championship games from 2003-2017\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to accomplish both tasks, two methods were created, getPredictionsChips and getPredictions. Both methods behave similarly, except getPredictionChips uses championship games as its test data set to output predictions and getPredictions uses a specified year as its test data set. In each method, a data set of historical NCAA tournament games is cleaned up by removing any qualitative columns or any column specifying a result from our baseline model. Once the training and test data sets are cleaned, a random forest classifier is created using the training data and predictions are made on the test data using the generated classifier. Each method returns a tuple with the following information: \n",
    "- _Output Predictions_ (outputPreds): A dataframe describing the prediction for each matchup, the actual result, and the probability for the predicted outcome to occur\n",
    "- _Baseline Model Accuracy_ (baselineAcc): The accuracy from our baseline model that predicted a game's outcome based on which team had the lower RPI\n",
    "- _Random Forest Classifier Accuracy_ (modelAcc): The accuracy from our random forest classifier that predicted a game's outcome on a variety of input features"
