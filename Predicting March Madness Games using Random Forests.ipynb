    "# Analysis Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Our goal from this analysis will be to predict the outcome of March Madness games. To do this, we will be using a Random Forest that takes in historical data from NCAA tourney matchups as input and outputs predictions for the winning team for each game in a March Madness tournament. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Baseline Model\n",
    "#### The baseline model we will use to compare our model's results against will be solely tied to a team's RPI. Our baseline model poses the following hypothesis: : \n",
    "That in any NCAA tournament game, the team with the lower RPI will win the game. \n",
    "Intuitively, this is a reasonable prediction. RPI (Ratings Percentage Index), ranks teams based on their wins, losses, and strength of schedule for the past season. If team A has a lower RPI than team B at the end of a season, it is fair to assume that team A's performance throughout the season has been at a higher level than team B's. For this reason, we can guess that any new basketball fan watching their first March Madness tournament would choose team A over team B in a game, disregarding any other biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest Approach\n",
    "We would like to build on our baseline model and see if we can develop an approach that more accurately predicts the outcome of games. One of the most exciting parts of March Madness is the array of upsets that occur throughout the tournament. In general, upsets occur when a team with a higher RPI beats a team with a lower RPI. We would like to create a model that performs better than our baseline model by more accurately predicting the outcome of games, in particular predicting when upsets occur. For us to accomplish this, we can utilize RPI as well as some additional attributes that provide more information surrounding each team's level of performance in the past season. These factors can be used to build a random forest in order to: \n",
    "1) Identify which factors are correlated to predicting the outcome of a game\n",
    "2) Predict when an upset is going to occur in March Madness\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a random forest by passing as input a data frame where each row corresponds to an NCAA tournament game. Each row will contain data regarding each team's yearly averages and totals in statistical categories, RPI, the game's outcome, and whether or not the team with the lowest RPI won. This last piece of information will be our dependent variable. The random forest will utilize each feature in our training data set describing the winning team and losing team's performance during the season, in order to learn which factors are tied to predicting the outcome of a game. Once the random forest has been trained, tournament data where the outcome of the each game has been excluded can be used as input to the model to generate a set of predictions for each game in that year's tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Sources Overview\n",
    "The data the was used to perform this analysis came from the Google Cloud & NCAA® ML Competition 2018-Men's Kaggle competition (Insert Link). The following is a brief summary of all the datasets that were used:\n",
    "- NCAATourneyCompactResults: Contains records from each NCAA tournament game from 1985-2017, including score and region.  \n",
    "- Teams: Contains information for each Division 1 (D1) basketball team including an ID, name, first and most recent year playing D1 basketball. \n",
    "- MasseyOrdinals_Prelim2018: Contains data from 2003-2017 surrounding each D1 team's rank from various rankings sources throughout. \n",
    "- RegularSeasonDetailedResults: Contains similar information as the NCAATourneyCompactResults dataset, with the addition that each row will also contain the totals in a variety of statistical categories for the winning team and losing team. These are categories that are often found in a boxscore. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more in depth description of each of the datasets that were used and additional datasets provided by Kaggle can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/c/mens-machine-learning-competition-2018/data\n",

    "In order to create our random forest, we need to complete the following:\n",
    "1. Settle on a set of statistics to evaluate the performance of each team. \n",
    "2. Create a data frame that represents a matchup that occurred in an NCAA tournament and contains our set of statistics for each team in the matchup \n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish task 1, the following statistics were calculated for each team:\n",
    "- Defensive Rebounds (DRB)\n",
    "- Efficient Field Goal Percentage (EFG)\n",
    "- Free Throws Attempted (FTA)\n",
    "- Free Throw Percentage (FTP)\n",
    "- Margin of Loss (MOL)\n",

    "- Offensive Effiency (oEff)\n",
    "- Rankings Percentage Index (RPI)\n",

    "- Wins vs. a Tournament Team (winsVsTourney)\n",
    "- Number of Games Played (numGamesPlayed)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of the last four, the yearly pre-tournament averages (regular season and conference tourney play) were found. The last three are cumulative totals, and RPI was found by using the latest ranking given to a team before the tournament. \n",
